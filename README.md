## EMG-Based Communication Aid (Bachelor's Project)
[Publication](https://)

Built an analog circuit for EMG signal acquisition, filtering, and triggering modular communication responses
based on the given input (clench or tap). Researched muscle signal characteristics, verified circuit function
using research sources, and explained the full process step-by-step. This shows my ability to fact-check,
analyze, and clearly document complex information.
